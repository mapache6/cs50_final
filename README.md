Project Title: Gratitude Garden

Summary

For the CS50 final project, I propose to create a “Gratitude Garden” – a place for logging a daily reflection on what one if most gratitude for, bg or small.
More than simply being a place to post a list, the Gratitude Garden will aim to help people develop the habits of reflection and cultivating inner meaning based on what really is of value to each person.
This could possibly help people to maintain or improve their mental health. This is especially important at a time when many people are rightly feeling anxious, worried and have plenty to feel down about.
The garden isn't meant to belittle anyone's problems but, hopefully, provide a peaceful place to think about what they personally cherish in life and how to bring more gratitude into their lives.

Project Details & Features

Every time there is a new note of gratitude logged, a flower or plant appears in the gratitude garden.
The garden starts out empty, but begins to be filled with seedlings with every entry.
When a user logs an action, such as telling someone how thankful they are, this "waters" their garden and a new flower appears.
After several dozen entries, a full garden will flourish and hopefully, the individual does too!

A Step-by-Step Guide through the Gratitude Garden website:

First, the user needs to register with a new username and password to enter the website.
The user must create a password that has a minimum of 8 characters.

Next, the user needds to login and will be redirected to the Homepage that has a welcome message and links to guide the user experience through the website.
The user is invited to "Be Grateful Today" where he/she is asked, using his/her username to ask what they are grateful for today.
The user enters 1 to 2 sentences of gratitude. The user is encouraged to to enter 1-2 sentences about something she/he/they are grateful for every day.
Once a comment has been entered, the user is redirected to the "Walk in Your Gratitude Garden" webpage.

The "Walk in Your Gratitude Garden" is a the user's personal garden where their gratitudes are collected, seeds are planted and flowers bloom.
The first time the user enters the garden, there won't be any flowers, seeds or comments. But once he/she has submitted a gratitude comment, it will appear in the garden.
Each gratitude entry generates a comment in the garden, accompanied by the date of entry and a seedling that has been planted!
But seeds need water to grow...

The last and final page is called "Watering Your Gratitude Garden".
Here, the user clicks on an action he/she has taken to demonstrate gratitude.
There are three buttons that look a bit like raindrops. If they have completed any of these acts of gratitude and click on a button, they will be redirected back to the garden.
This time, the garden will have a flower blooming! Every action results in a new flower blooming.
Even if someone only has a few or even just one comment of gratitude, they can still grow a whole garden and water it regularly by acting on their gratitude.
