Project Title: Gratitude Garden

Summary of Design

Below is a description of the technical features included the Gratitude Garden website design:

•	Registration
•   Login
•	Username (appears in the 'Be Grateful Today' webpage to welcome the user by username).
•	Password protected (minimum of 8 characters are required for security).
•   Gratitude Garden Home: this is the landing page and first way to navigate through the website. There is also a navigation bar and 'return to home' link on each page.
•	Be Grateful Today Webpage: Prompts user to enter 1-2 sentences about something she/he/they are grateful for every day.
•   Walk in Your Gratitude Garden Webpage: the user's personal garden where their gratitudes are collected, seeds are planted and flowers bloom.
•   Watering Your Garden Webpage: here the user can click on one of three actions they have taken to cultivate gratitude. Upon clicking an action, the page redirects to the garden where a new rose will appear.
•	SQL Database called "gardendata.db" where I store & update user information under two tables - users and gratitudes.
•	HTML & CSS were be used for the website structure and style to give a calm, peaceful and beautiful experience of a garden.
•	Javascript or python were used for a number of the website features (username, login, password, etc.)
•	I stored an image of the flower that will be drawn upon each time a gratitude entry is made. These plants will populate the garden. I used the website Pexels.com to use opensource content.
•   The gratitude messages appear next to the seeds and dates the comments were entered in the gratitude garden.
•   Each flower and message of gratitude has a date from when the entry was made.
